### Getting Involved in Open Source

#### Who am I?
* Wanted to get involved in open source six months ago, but didn't think I could make a contribution
* In October: started working with GNOME OPW and Wikimedia.

#### What is [OPW](https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen) and [GSOC](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2014)?
* Full-time, 4-month internships with different OSS organizations.
* OPW is targeted at women, and GSOC for full-time students.
* Before you apply, you must find a mentor and make a small contribution.

#### What is Free and Open Source Software?
* Free software meets the four freedoms:
 * the freedom to run a piece of software for any purpose
 * the freedom to understand and change it
 * the freedom to share copies of the software
 * and the freedom to share changed or modified copies.
* "Open source" means pretty much the same thing (although diehard "free" software folks will disagree)

#### Why get involved in open source projects?
* You're working on something that you already like or use and making it better!
* You're doing a public service
* Great way to get real-life, non-classroom programming experience
* Unlike proprietary software, you can tell everyone what you did

#### How to find open source projects
* What kind of OSS do you use that you want to improve?
* Examples: firefox, emacs/vim, PLs, linux, web frameworks, apache
* If not, try Google, Github, OpenHatch, OhLoh
 * Note that some projects may be abandoned!
 * Look at their bugtracker, see what languages they use.

#### What you can contribute -- not just code!
* UX design, such as logos
* Translation and localization!
* Testing and documentation: What good is a project if no one knows how to use it? 

#### How do people communicate in open source projects?
* Wiki: Like a marsh. Requires the least effort, but often outdated or convoluted.
 * Example: [Parsoid](www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid)
* Bug / issue tracker
 * "Status" is important! "Closed", "New" or "Unconfirmed", "Accepted", "In Progress".
 * Example: [GNOME](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Gnumeric&query_format=advanced&order=bug_status%2Cpriority%2Cassigned_to%2Cbug_id&query_based_on=)
 * Example: [OpenHatch](http://openhatch.org/bugs/)
* Mailing list: Like a river.
 * Not just for announcements! Used by both developers and users to report bugs, request features, talk about technical issues, etc.
 * Example: [Ubuntu] (https://lists.ubuntu.com/)
* IRC: Like a waterfall!
 * Hardest to adapt to; kind of like being at a party where you don't know anyone
 * Still the most effective way to get an answer to your question.
* Meetups and conferences!
 * [SF Open Source Developer Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Open-Source-Developers/)
 * OpenSourceBridge (Portland), Libre Planet (Boston)

#### How do you start getting involved with an open source project?
* Come up with a "hook" that you can use on IRC or the mailing list. 
* Should fulfill the following requirements:
 * Can this person independently navigate the resources my project has on the website? (base level initiative)
 * Is this person trying to do something that would be helpful to me?
 * Does the email have a concrete, testable goal/outcome in mind?
 * Is there a specific ask I could help with?
 * Is there a way I can publicly respond to this person? (not bottlenecking)

Hi there! As a learning project, I'm interested in creating
or improving a Bicho backend to integrate with an open source
bugtracker; Trac seems a likely candidate. I plan on diving
into the Bicho source code (including existing backends)
and the Trac API today to start looking at what to do. 
Any tips, warnings, or requests?

I'm XXX and I'm really interested in contributing to
CryptoCat. I noticed  that "adding tests" was mentioned
on the issue tracker, so I'd like to start by working on
 testing. I have a few questions:
1. I don't see very many tests in the test/ folder.
Is there another place where I ought to be looking?
2. Can you confirm that you're using Jasmine for testing?
(It looks like you may be, but this isn't documented 
anywhere so I'm not sure if my guess is right.) Or are
you using another test framework?
3. Are there certain parts of the codebase that
particularly need test coverage?

I've also filed <<BUG #XYZ>>, "CryptoCat icon isn't 
showing up on desktop notifications", which I would
be happy to start working on if someone could get me
started. I'm <<NICKNAME>> on IRC and will try to hang
out there as much as I can. 

I'm new to open source contribution and would appreciate
it greatly if someone could help me get started on my
first patch/test.
```

### Workshop

#### Project Brainstorming
* Start researching projects you might contribute to!
* With your group, share which project and why.

#### Come up with a question.
* Find a pretext to get the conversation started, and draft a question
* When you are done drafting your question, share it with the group
