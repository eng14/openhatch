### Getting Involved in Open Source

#### Who am I?
* Wanted to get involved in open source six months ago, but didn't think I could make a contribution
* In October: started working with GNOME OPW and Wikimedia.

#### What is [OPW](https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen) and [GSOC](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2014)?
* Full-time, 4-month internships with different OSS organizations.
* OPW is targeted at women, and GSOC for full-time students.
* Before you apply, you must find a mentor and make a small contribution.

#### What is Free and Open Source Software?
* Free software meets the four freedoms:
 * the freedom to run a piece of software for any purpose
 * the freedom to understand and change it
 * the freedom to share copies of the software
 * and the freedom to share changed or modified copies.
* "Open source" means pretty much the same thing (although diehard "free" software folks will disagree)

#### Why get involved in open source projects?
* You're working on something that you already like or use and making it better!
* You're doing a public service
* Great way to get real-life, non-classroom programming experience
 * As a software engineer: Learn tools used in industry, like version control, bug trackers, code review systems. Get used to the process of code review.
 * As a designer: Work with a team to design a logo / website that fits their needs.
* Unlike proprietary software, you can tell everyone what you did
 * Example: my [Gerrit](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/q/owner:%22Mariapacana+%253Cmaria.pacana%2540gmail.com%253E%22,n,z) page

#### How to find open source projects
* What kind of OSS do you use that you want to improve?
 * Examples of OSS: web frameworks, Firefox, emacs/vim, programming languages, Linux kernel, CryptoCat, OTR chat...
* If not, try Google, Github, OpenHatch, OhLoh
 * Note that some projects may be abandoned!
 * Look at their bugtracker, see what languages they use.

#### What you can contribute -- not just code!
* UX design, such as logos
* Translation and localization!
* Testing and documentation: What good is a project if no one knows how to use it? 

#### How do people communicate in open source projects?
* Wiki: Like a marsh. Requires the least effort, but often outdated or convoluted.
 * Example: [Parsoid](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid)
* Bug / issue tracker
 * "Status" is important! "Closed", "New" or "Unconfirmed", "Accepted", "In Progress".
 * Example: [GNOME](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Gnumeric&query_format=advanced&order=bug_status%2Cpriority%2Cassigned_to%2Cbug_id&query_based_on=)
 * Example: [OpenHatch](http://openhatch.org/bugs/)
* Mailing list: Like a river.
 * Not just for announcements! Used by both developers and users to report bugs, request features, talk about technical issues, etc.
 * Example: [Ubuntu] (https://lists.ubuntu.com/)
* IRC: Like a waterfall!
 * Hardest to adapt to; kind of like being at a party where you don't know anyone
 * Still the most effective way to get an answer to your question.
* Meetups and conferences!
 * [SF Open Source Developer Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Open-Source-Developers/)
 * OpenSourceBridge (Portland), Libre Planet (Boston)

#### How do you start getting involved with an open source project?
* Come up with a "hook" that you can use on IRC or the mailing list. 
* Should fulfill the following requirements (hat tip [Mel Chua](http://blog.melchua.com/)):
 * Can this person independently navigate the resources my project has on the website? (base level initiative)
 * Is this person trying to do something that would be helpful to me?
 * Is there a specific ask I could help with?
 * Is there a way I can publicly respond to this person? (not bottlenecking)

##### Sample Email #1
```
Hi there, I'm XXX and really excited about ClojureScript.
(I couldn't find a separate discussion forum for
ClojureScript, so I'm sending this here, but please
let me know if there's a better place to ask this 
question.)

I'd like to get started contributing, am taking a look
through the open Issues on Jira and found one that I'd
like to work on:

1. CLJS-150 Regular Expressions don't support Javascript
mode flags. The last comment is Feb. 2012 but this still
seems to be open. David's comment on Jira makes it sound
like this bug might be a "wontfix," but I am not sure.
Could someone please clarify whether this is still an
open ticket? (Also, is this a very complex problem? If
there's a better bug for me to get started on I'm
willing to do that instead.)

I'm <<NICK>> on IRC and will try to hang out in #clojure
as much as I can. Thanks for any help you can give!
```

##### Sample Email #2
```
I'm XXX and I'm really interested in contributing to
CryptoCat. I noticed  that "adding tests" was mentioned
on the issue tracker, so I'd like to start by working on
 testing. I have a few questions:
1. I don't see very many tests in the test/ folder.
Is there another place where I ought to be looking?
2. Can you confirm that you're using Jasmine for testing?
(It looks like you may be, but this isn't documented 
anywhere so I'm not sure if my guess is right.) Or are
you using another test framework?
3. Are there certain parts of the codebase that
particularly need test coverage?

I've also filed <<BUG #XYZ>>, "CryptoCat icon isn't 
showing up on desktop notifications", which I would
be happy to start working on if someone could get me
started. I'm <<NICK>> on IRC and will try to hang
out there as much as I can. 

I'm new to open source contribution and would appreciate
it greatly if someone could help me get started on my
first patch/test.
```

#### Tips for Newbies
* Don't be afraid of IRC.
* Don't try to understand everything at once.
 * Getting the 'big picture' can take 3-4 months!
 * Concentrate on making a small contribution right away.
* Find a mentor, whether it's formal or informal.
 * Where to find mentors?
  * The most responsive person often becomes your mentor (informally)
  * You can also go to OpenHatch and look for mentors there
 * Why have a mentor?
  * They help you understand the codebase
  * Will defend your perspective to the other developers
* Try to understand the team's culture / who the key people are.
 * Whose approval do you need before the patch is merged?

### Workshop

#### Project Brainstorming
* Start researching projects you might contribute to!
* With your group, share which project and why.

#### Come up with a question.
* Find a pretext to get the conversation started, and draft a question
* When you are done drafting your question, share it with the group
