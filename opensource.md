#### Who am I?
* Wanted to get involved in open source six months ago, but didn't think I could make a contribution
* In October: started working with GNOME OPW and Wikimedia.

#### What is [OPW](https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen) and [GSOC](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2014)?
* Full-time, 4-month internships with different OSS organizations.
* OPW is targeted at women, and GSOC for full-time students.
* Before you apply, you must find a mentor and make a small contribution.

#### What is Free and Open Source Software?
* Free software meets the four freedoms:
 * the freedom to run a piece of software for any purpose
 * the freedom to understand and change it
 * the freedom to share copies of the software
 * and the freedom to share changed or modified copies.
* "Open source" means pretty much the same thing (although diehard "free" software folks will disagree)

#### Why get involved in open source projects?
* You're working on something that you already like or use and making it better!
* You're doing a public service
* Great way to get real-life, non-classroom programming experience
* Unlike proprietary software, you can tell everyone what you did

#### How to find open source projects
* What kind of OSS do you use that you want to improve?
* Examples: firefox, emacs/vim, PLs, linux, web frameworks, apache
* If not, try Google, Github, OpenHatch, OhLoh
 * Note that some projects may be abandoned!
 * Look at their bugtracker, see what languages they use.

#### What you can contribute -- not just code!
* UX design, such as logos
* Translation and localization!
* Testing and documentation: What good is a project if no one knows how to use it? 

#### How do people communicate in open source projects?
* Wiki: Like a marsh. Requires the least effort, but often outdated or convoluted.
 * Example: [Parsoid](www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid)
* bug / issue tracker
 * Example: [GNOME](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Gnumeric&query_format=advanced&order=bug_status%2Cpriority%2Cassigned_to%2Cbug_id&query_based_on=)
 * Example: [OpenHatch](http://openhatch.org/bugs/)
* mailing list: river
* Example: [Ubuntu] (https://lists.ubuntu.com/)
* IRC: Like a waterfall!
 * Hardest to adapt to; kind of like being at a party where you don't know anyone
 * Still the most effective way to get an answer to your question.
* Meetups and conferences!
 * [SF Open Source Developer Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Open-Source-Developers/)
 * OpenSourceBridge (Portland), Libre Planet (Boston)

#### How do you start getting involved with an open source project?
* Hop on irc and introduce yourself
 * be extremely direct, get to the point right away
* Send a very targeted email
 * Can this person independently navigate the resources my project has on the website? (base level initiative)
 * Is this person trying to do something that would be helpful to me?
 * Does the email have a concrete, testable goal/outcome in mind?
 * Is there a specific ask I could help with?
 * Is there a way I can publicly respond to this person? (not bottlenecking)

#### Workshop

## Project Brainstorming
* Start researching projects you might contribute to!
* With your group, share which project and why.

## Come up with a question.
* Find a pretext to get the conversation started, and draft a question
* When you are done drafting your question, share it with the group
