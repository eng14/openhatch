# what is gnome OPW

# what is open source
	free software must meet the "four freedoms": the freedom to run a piece of software for any purpose; the freedom to understand and change it; the freedom to share copies of the software; and the freedom to share changed or modified copies.
	"Open source" was coined in the late 90s to appeal to businesses and is now the more popular term, but they mean pretty much the same thing

# why get involved in open source projects
	## you're working on something that you already like or use and making it better!
	## you're doing a public service
	## great learning experience if you are a new programmer
	## unlike proprietary software, you can tell everyone what you did

# how to find open source projects
	## what kind of OSS do you use that you want to improve?
	## what's OSS and we don't know it's OSS? 
		### firefox, emacs/vim, PLs, linux, web frameworks, apache
		### nginx
	## if you really have no idea: google, github, openhatch, ohloh
	## check their bugtracker, see what languages they use

# how do people communicate in open source projects?
	## wiki: like a marsh. requires the least effort, but often outdated or convoluted
	## bug / issue tracker
	## mailing list: like a river
		example: https://lists.ubuntu.com/
	## irc: like a ...waterfall? 
		### you don't have to instantly respond
		### i'd often post a question on irc and be inundated with feedback
	## face-to-face meetings. conferences etc!

# how do you start getting involved with an open source project?
	## you can hop on irc and introduce yourself
		### be extremely direct, get to the point right away
	## you can send a very targeted email
	## look at the issues page on github or the bug tracker. 
		### even updating the documentation is valuable...or testing...or finding bugs and reporting them
			#### type "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" again and again

# for the next 15 minutes
	## everyone look for an OS project that you might make a contribution to
	## with your group, share the project and why you might want to do that

# for the next 15 minutes
	## find a pretext to get the conversation started, and draft a question
	## when you are done drafting your question, share it with the group

---- what if it's abandoned?
---- background affects what people can work on
